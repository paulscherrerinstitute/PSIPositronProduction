quadrupole magnets in a transport line.

ltp375MeV.lte
	Lattice file

scanQuad
	Bash script to run a scan of K1 for a given quadrupole.
	It uses scanTemplate.ele as the input file for elegant
	The number of the quadrupole must be given on the commandline
	E.g., to scan LTP:Q7, use
	% scanQuad 7
	After running, a bunch of plot windows will pop up.
	Read the script file for more description
	
scanTemplate.ele
	Template command file for scanning a quadrupole.
	The quadrupole is misaligned by +1mm in x and y, so we can
	get an idea of the sensitivity.

fitSlopes
        After running scanQuad, can be used to fit the BPM readings vs
        quad strength. E.g.,
        % fitSlopes 7
