This directory contains files to simulate girder misalignment for
NSLS-II.  The files were created by S. Kramer and M. Borland.

To run the simulations:
% runAlignmentSeq
This will automatically process and plot the results.  It will take some
time as 100 ensembles are simulated.   By reading the script runAlignmentSeq,
one can learn how the simulation is done.

To reprocess and display the results:
% processAlignmentSeq

To clean up results files
% cleanUp
