Example of including rf phase and amplitude noise in a tracking simulation.
An ILMATRIX element is used to model the ring, in order to speed up the simulations.
We determine the amount of beam centroid motion resulting from the noise.

run0.ele
        Initial run. Creates files needed by subsequent runs.

ILMatrixSetup
ILMatrix.xref
        Used to create ILMatrix.sdds, used by run1.ele and run2.ele to configure the ILMATRIX element.

SREffects.xref
SREffectsSetup
        Used to create SREffects.sdds, used by run1.ele and run2.ele to configure the SREFFECTS element.

run1.ele
        Run without any errors
run2.ele
        Run with phase and amplitude errors
