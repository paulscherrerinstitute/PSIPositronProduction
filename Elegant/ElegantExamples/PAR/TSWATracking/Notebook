Example of tracking to get tune shift with amplitude
M. Borland, ANL, 2013

In this example, track a set of particles distributed in x(0) and then figure out after the
fact what the amplitude and tune of each is. Suitable for parallel tracking, but postprocessing
is more involved.

parTrack.ele     command input file
parTrack.lte     lattice input file

process1         Processes parTrack.w1 to get horizontal tune vs amplitude using NAFF
process2         Similar, but performs FFT and makes a waterfall plot
plot2            Makes some plots after running process1, process2
