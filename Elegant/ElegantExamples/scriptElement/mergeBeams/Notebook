Example of using the script element.

In this example, we merge a series of extra beams into a simulation
that already has a beam.  The merging is done with the mergeBeams
script.

To run this example:
% elegant run.ele
% sddsplot -column=s,Particles run.cen
% sddsplot -column=s,S[xys] run.sig -graph=line,vary
