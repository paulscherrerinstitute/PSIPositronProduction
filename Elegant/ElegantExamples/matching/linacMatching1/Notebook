These files give an example of matching a linac in steps.

part1.ele
        Match from the photoinjector to the last dipole in the compressor chicane

part2.ele
        Match from the last dipole in the chicane through the three-screen emittance
        measurument section

part3.ele
        Match from the three-screen system to the end of the linac

More details are in the .ele files.
