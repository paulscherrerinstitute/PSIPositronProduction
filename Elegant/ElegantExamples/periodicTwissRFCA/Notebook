Demonstration that one can't have periodic beta functions in a FODO cell array with linac structures.
M. Borland (ANL)

! Run elegant for a cell, with matched=1
elegant run-cell.ele
! Beam sizes are approximately periodic
sddsplot -column=s,S[xy] run-cell.sig -graph=line,vary 
! Beta functions are not
sddsplot -column=s,beta[xy] run-cell.twi -graph=line,vary 
! Compute beta functions from beam sizes
sddsprocess run-cell.sig \
            -define=col,beta%s,"S%s sqr e%s /",units=m,select=S[xy],edit=d
! Compare to twiss_output, see good agreement
sddsplot -column=s,beta[xy] run-cell.sig run-cell.twi \
         -graph=line,vary 

! Run many cells, starting with same conditions
elegant run.ele
! Show that beam sizes are not periodic
sddsplot -column=s,S[xy] run.sig -graph=line,vary

Depending on the beam energy and the energy gain in the cell, the
matched beta functions will be more or less periodic.  The reason is
that elegant propagates the beta functions using the transfer matrix,
which does not have unit determinant (because of the acceleration).

If you have track a beam starting with the matched beta functions
elegant finds, the beam sizes should be close to periodic for that
cell.  However, if you concatenate several cells, the beam sizes won't
be periodic.  They can't be, because as the beam accelerates, the
determinant of the matrix becomes closer to unity and the end focusing
decreases in strength.
