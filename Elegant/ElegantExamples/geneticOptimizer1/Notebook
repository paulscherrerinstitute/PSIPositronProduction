Example of using the geneticOptimizer script.  M. Borland (APS), 6/2009.

To use this script, you need to have a linux cluster available that
allows submitting jobs using the "csub" command.  You may need to
modify geneticOptimizer to use your local job submission scheme.

This example is an optimization problem that one should not actually
use a genetic optimizer for, as elegant's internal optimizer will be
faster than more effective. However, it illustrates how to implement a
genetic optimization.  It runs fairly quickly so it is easy to monitor
and understand.

Input files:
optim1.sdds      Configuration file
runJob1          Script to run a job
processJob1      Script to compute penalty function from the job
template.ele     Elegant input file template
fodo.lte         Lattice file

To execute:
% geneticOptimizer -input optim1.sdds -reduce 1
Let it run for a while.  In a separate window, look at the results using
% sddsplot -device=motif,"-movie true -keep 1" -repeat -column=runID,penaltyValue optim1.all -graph=sym
The results will initial be quite noisy.
After a while, use control-C to exit geneticOptimizer.  Then restart with 10x smaller errors
% geneticOptimizer -input optim1.sdds -reduce 1 -contin 1 -errorFactor 0.1
Continue this procedure until it converges satisfactorily

Output files:
optim1.all      Log of all the function evaluations
optim1.best     Best results so far
optim1-*        Results for individual runs. Using "-reduce 1" means that geneticOptimizer
                only keeps the best results.
