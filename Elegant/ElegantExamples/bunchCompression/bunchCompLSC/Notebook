This run shows show to include longitudinal space charge (LSC) into a
simulation of a linac with a bunch compressor.  Getting a reliable
LSC simulation requires using a lot of macroparticles.  The user
is warned to vary the number of macroparticles, the binning parameters,
and the smoothing/filtering parameters for LSC and CSR to ensure
reliable results.
