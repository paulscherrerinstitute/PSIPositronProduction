There are four separate examples in this directory, all relevant
to a system consisting of a (linac, bunch-compressor, linac) system.

A basic linac and four dipole chicane simulation with CSR and wakefields:
% ./fourDipoleCSR

A simulation of the sensitivity to changes in the initial beam timing:
% ./dtSweep

A simulation of the sensitivity to changes in the phase of the upstream linac:
% ./phaseSweep

A simulation of the effect of operating the compressor for different beam energy:
% ./energySweep
