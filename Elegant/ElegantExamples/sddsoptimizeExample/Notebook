Simple example of running an optimization using sddsoptimize. M. Borland, ANL

In this example, we vary a strength fudge factor for a set of quadrupoles in the
PTB transport line in order to attempt to match measured H and V response matrices.

Files:
ptb.lte
        Lattice file
standard-H.sdds
        Experimentally-measured horizontal response matrix
standard-V.sdds
        Experimentally-measured vertical response matrix
standard_quadUniform.ele
        Elegant command file that computes the response matrices after fudging all the 
        quad strengths by a given factor
quadUniformVarFile.sdds
        Input file for sddsoptimize, specifying the optimization variables (there's only one)
quadUniformRunScript
        Script to run the simulation for a single trial value
quadUniformMeasScript
        Script to "measure" the result of the last-run simulation, returning (to stdout) a
        number that is to be minimized. In this case, the number is just the mean-squared
        error between the experimental and simulated response matrix.

Command to run
sddsoptimize -measScript=quadUniformMeasScript -varScript=quadUniformRunScript -varFile=quadUniformVarFile.sdds \
             -simplex=eval=100,cycles=3,restart=1 -logFile=optim1.log -restart=optim1.restart  -verbose

Command to compare results to experiment
sddsplot -graph=sym,vary=subtype,fill -groupby=names -sep=names -same=global \
         -column=s,*:* standard-[HV].sddscal -legend=spec=Experiment \
         -column=s,*:* standard_quadUniform.[hv]rm -legend=spec=Matched
