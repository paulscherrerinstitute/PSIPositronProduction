By default, when elegant imparts FSEs (fractional strength errors) to a
dipole, the strength of the multipoles (e.g., K1, K2, etc) is also changed.
The assumption is that the error comes from variation of the power supply,
rather than construction tolerances.  This example shows how to use link_elements
to defeat this linkage.

Example by M. Borland (ANL).
