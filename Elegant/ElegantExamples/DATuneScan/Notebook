These files are used for performing a 2d tune scan of the dynamic
aperture.  Example by M. Borland, ANL.

N.B.: I doubt this example will run on Windows computers.  If anyone
wants to modify it, I'd appreciate having the modified version.

The lattice file for this example is aps.lte, which is a simplified APS lattice.

To run this example, proceed as follows
1. Determine nominal lattice functions and tunes:
% elegant startingPoint.ele

2. Make the tune knob response matrix and inverse
% makeTuneResponse

3. Run the tune scan
% scanTunes

If you have a cluster, edit scanTunes first to set "cluster" to 1 and (optionally) replace the
csub command with your own job submission command.

4. Look at the results
% collateScan

You can do this while the tune scan proceeds.  It will show partial results if at least two
runs have completed.

List of files:
aps.lte                        Lattice file
collateScan	               Script to collate tune scan results
daTemplate.ele	               Template for dynamic aperture runs, used by scanTunes script.
                               Some errors are included to reduce the DA (too much, actually)
makeTuneResponse               Script to make tune response matrix and inverse
scanTunes                      Script to perform tune scans
startingPoint.ele              elegant input file for determining the nominal lattice parameters
tuneResponseTemplate.ele       Template for tune knob determination
cleanUp                        Cleans up (deletes) results files
