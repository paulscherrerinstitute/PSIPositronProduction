# Pcubed standard format

A very simple ASCII file format to store particle distributions within the framework of the Pcubed project.
The aim is to define a standardized interface between the different simulation codes:

* Geant4
* ASTRA
* Elegant

This should simplify the development of an end-to-end simulation of the Pcubed experiment.


## Structure

TODO.
