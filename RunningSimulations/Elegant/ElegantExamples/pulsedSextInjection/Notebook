Files to demonstrate use and optimization of MBUMPER elements for simulating
multiple kicker magnets.

Example by M. Borland, ANL.

aps.lte
        APS lattice file

twiss1.ele
        Run to compute twiss parameters.  Output of this run is needed by other runs.

waveform.sdds
        Waveform file for the kickers (half sine-wave)

inj1Test0.ele
        Runs 50 passes around APS with multiple kickers set at some values that were    
        chosen by hand.  The beam is completely lost fairly quickly.
        
inj1.ele
        Optimizes the kicker strengths to improve capture.
        Best run with parallel elegant.

inj1Test1.ele
        Runs with optimized strengths for 50 turns.  Not much better.
