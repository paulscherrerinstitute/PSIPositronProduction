This is an example of using Pelegant to perform momentum aperture computations.
Example by M. Borland and Y. Wang.

You need to modify the path variable in run_Pelegant to match your MPI
installation.  Following that, try

elegant run0.ele
run_Pelegant run1.ele 

sddsplot -column=s,delta????tive run1.mmap
