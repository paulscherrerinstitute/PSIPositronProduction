Common parameters
	SzEdge = 10*lambda 
	edges are 4 sigma
	center is 10 sigma
	20 bins per wavelength
	--> 3600 bins

Scripts (a little stripped down to work without oagtclsh)
	runBeamU <rootname>
	e.g. runBeamU set12
	This will create lots of csh scripts called set12-?.job
	Submit the scripts if you have a queue, or run them sequentially like this (assuming bash shell)
	for file in set12-?.job; do $file; done

	processHist <rootname>
	Run this after all the jobs are done.  Makes files <rootname>-*.naff
	Try
	sddsplot -column=s,Amplitude set12-*.naff -graph=line,vary -mode=y=normalize -legend=parameter=modWavelength

Parameters on this run work well
set12	4MP, 1% MA, 100A, LP filter (0.20, 0.21), 1/3 length system
