Example of basic run with main and harmonic cavity beamloading, rf feedback,
beam feedback, and impedance for 24 bunches.
The bunch form factor is used in setting up the rf phase setpoint.

Source files:
lattice.lte
        Lattice file, including the full element-by-element lattice and 
        beamlines for use in fast tracking

AmpFeedbackFilters.sdds
PhaseFeedbackFilters.sdds
        From T. Berenc, used to model rf feedback for main cavity.

Basic.ele
        Basic run for setting up fast tracking, getting lattice parameters

ILMatrixSetup
ILMatrix.xref
        Set up ILMATRIX for fast tracking. Makes the file ILMatrix.sdds
        One can also copy this file from elsewhere, e.g., from a tracking
        based determination.

SREffectsSetup
SREffects.xref
        Set up SREFFECTS For fast tracking

beamLoadCalcHHC
computeBunchLength
beamLoadXref.sdds
        Precalculate beamloading including iterative solution for the bunch length.
        Allows computing the synchronous phase setpoint for the main cavities
        Create parameter file to set up RFMODE elements including feedback

makeBunch
makeBunch.ele
        Makes a single bunch (duplicated for tracking).
        Used by runCases.

makeDiagParamFile
        Makes a "diagnostic" setup file to configure WATCH and HISTOGRAM elements.
        Used by runCases.

ring_rw.impe
ring_zt.impe
ring_zz.impe
        Old impedance files from Y.C. Chae
        Should really sum these to make a single impedance for better performance.

runTemplate.ele
        Template for running with impedance and longitudinal feedback
runCases
        Run jobs. Needs modification for local queueing system.
        Read the comments in this script!

TFBFirSetup
        Script to configure transverse bunch-by-bunch feedback FIR filters.
        This script will be distributed in version 29.1 of elegant.
