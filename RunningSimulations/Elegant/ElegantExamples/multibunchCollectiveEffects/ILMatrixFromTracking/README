Description of files

lattice.lte
        Sample lattice file (present APS)

Basic.ele
	Adjust the tunes and chromaticities, find lattice parameters.

closedOrbit.ele
        Find closed orbit vs momentum offset

frequencyMap.ele
        Tunes and path-length vs (x, y)

tuneFootprint.ele
        Tunes vs momentum offset

ILMatrixFromFmap
ILMatrix.xref
        Analyzes results from all the elegant runs and makes
        ILMatrix.sdds, which can be loaded into elegant
        The ILMATRIX element is assumed to be named RING1

Sequence of operations.

elegant Basic.ele

elegant closedOrbit.ele

!! <cores> is the number of cores to use. For this case, up to 4096 (64x64) based on
!! the values of nx and ny in frequencyMap.ele
mpiexec -np <cores> Pelegant frequencyMap.ele

!! <cores> is the number of cores to use. For this example, up to 128 based on the
!! value of ndelta in tuneFootprint.ele
