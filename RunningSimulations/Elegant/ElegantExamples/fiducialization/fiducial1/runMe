# Example of fiducialization with a fiducial bunch and a
# perturbed bunch.  The system in question is a linac with
# 50 structures, a four dipole chicane, then 50 more structures.
# Example by M. Borland, APS.

# Generate the beam and accelerate it to the chicane center
elegant makeBeam1.ele

# Apply scattering and energy loss to the beam
elegant makeBeam2.ele

# Combine the ideal and scattered beams, one per page
sddscombine beam1.out beam2.out -overwrite combined.out

# Run both beams through the rest of the chicane and the second
# half of the linac.  The first (unscattered) beam is used 
# as the fiducial.
