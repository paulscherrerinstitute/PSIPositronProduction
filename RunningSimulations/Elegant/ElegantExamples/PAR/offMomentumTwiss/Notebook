Example of computing off-momentum twiss parameters.

To run:
% runScan
% collateScan

You'll note that the linear terms from the fits (on the plot labels) are the same
as the derivative terms from the parameter values in the on-momentum file, once 
you adjust for the fact that the fits have delta in percent.
