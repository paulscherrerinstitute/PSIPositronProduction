This is a simple example of optimizing a system by tracking a beam.
We use a beam generated with the rf gun simulation program spiffe, for
the APS thermionic rf gun.  We track through a drift space with an
alpha magnet.  The alpha magnet strength and drift length are optimized
to minimize the bunch length.
