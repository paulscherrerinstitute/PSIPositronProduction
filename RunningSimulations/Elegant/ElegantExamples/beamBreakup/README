Sequence

!! Run simulation. Should take ~30s or less
elegant run1.ele
!! Plot <x'> vs <t>
sddsplot -parameter=Ct,Cxp run1.fin
!! Plot (t-<t>, x') for each bunch, color-coded by bunch number
sddsprocess run1.out -redefine=col,dt,"t Step 1 - 2856e6 / -",units=s
sddsplot -column=dt,xp run1.out -split=page -order=spectral -graph=dot,vary
!! Plot voltage in the mode vs time. Note that this is the amplitude of the
!! voltage, not the voltage seen by the beam.
