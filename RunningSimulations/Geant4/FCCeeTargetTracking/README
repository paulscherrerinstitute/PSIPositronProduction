1. Please setup Geant4 and 'G4_CMAKE_DIR' (needed in compile.sh). For example, do as what I do:

  > source setup.sh

  (Or setup your own Geant4)

2. Go to run_Injector and compile

  > cd run_Injector

  > ./compile.sh

  (Or create your own Injector/CMakeLists.txt before compile)

3. Run the simulation

  > ./run.sh
